# time-tracker-project

This is a time tracker management project that I worked on in the Fall 2021 semester. 
The website is built using Python, HTML, Django, and Bootstrap. 
It allows users to create tasks and track how much time they spent on that task.
Additionally, there is a dashboard which enables users to look at data revolving around the tasks they have done.

Here are some screenshots of the project:
